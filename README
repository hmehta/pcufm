pcufm - perl coreutils filemanager

This software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL, http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and comes with absolutely no warranty.

Introduction
pcufm is a lightweight curses coreutils filemanager. The main purpose is to easen up file operations with multiple files and shorten often longer and clumsy bash filemanaging sessions.
Note: Please take into consideration that this software is nowhere near complete and should be considered early alpha. It should be stable enough for testing purposes tho.

Requirements
- Perl >= 5.10
- Ncurses libraries
  * Should be available via distributions package manager
- CPAN Modules:
  * Curses
  * File::Copy::Recursive
  (Note: These are most likely available via your distributions package manager, both modules have installers included in case)

Features
- Simple, yet effective interface
- Lightweight and highly configurable
- Themeable, progress/scrollbars
- Searching files
- Vi-like keybindings by default
- Vi-style :commands
- Tab-completion
- Relatively gentle learning curve

Commands
- Commands are always executed on entry on the active selection bar or on all selected entries
- move, copy, remove (normal + rmtree)
- mkdir, renaming

TODO
- .mailcap support/internal MIME-handler (BLAARRGGHH!!1)
- tab-completion (for files!?!)
- regexp search
- something liek find?
- selections within directory structure?
- better scalability when resizing terminal
